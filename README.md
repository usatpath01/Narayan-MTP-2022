This repository contains code for performance analysis of eBPF tail calls.

`main_tail.py` is main file
and data generated by it, is contained in `out<syscallname>.csv` file

We are also trying to trace syscalls called from a container. 
We used strace, for that it seems so far we can **only** trace syscalls from within the container.

We can install strace in container 
`apt install -y strace` and then trace


We wanted to check the tracing ablity for ebpf inside docker
`docker build -t <imagename> .`
